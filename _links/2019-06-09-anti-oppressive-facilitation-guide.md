A must read:

> Even organizations with great meeting process inadvertently perpetuate barriers to full participation and access to democratic process. This happens through group dynamics of power, privilege and oppression that often marginalize women, people of color, queer, trans and gender non-conforming folks, people with disabilities and those with limited access to the cultural cues and financial resources that come with class privilege.
>
> Whether or not you act as facilitator at meetings you attend, building your facilitation skills will help you make your meetings better, more inclusive, and more fully democratic! Here are some foundational tips and suggestions that can have big impacts on your meetings.

I especially like the “Community Agreements”:

1. One diva, one mic
2. No one knows everything; together we know a lot
3. Move up, move up
4. We can’t be articulate all the time
5. Be aware of time
6. Embrace curiosity
7. Acknowledge the difference between intent and impact

This strikes me as thoughtfully and lovingly put together, battle tested. I’ve used some similar ground rules in class in the past, but am looking forward to trying more of this language in the future.
