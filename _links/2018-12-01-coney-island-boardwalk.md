OMG I love these old postcards of the boardwalk at Coney Island.

> The wood planks of the Coney Island Boardwalk were designed to accommodate two kinds of traffic: pedestrian and rolling chair. The sections with diagonal planks forming a chevron pattern were meant for foot traffic, whereas the two strips of straight planks were meant for rolling chairs.

If you ever visit New York, I really recommend the trip out to Coney Island. It's kind of a bizarre place so close to such a huge international city. I recommend the freak show, a corn dog or two, and a stroll down the boardwalk.

If it's nice out, take a nap on the pier. Don't forget sunblock.
