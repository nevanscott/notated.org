I love reading about nerdy design processes like this on [from Alex Hollander](https://alexhollender.com):

> In other words, Wikipedia — a major, legacy website (top 10 ranked, for 10+ years) — had an interface that hadn’t been changed for 15 years. And then one day the Chief Product Officer came to our team (1 product manager, ~6 engineers, 1 quality assurance person, ½ a scrum master, ½ a data analyst, ½ a community liaison, and myself), and tasked us with making significant improvements. It might honestly be a once-in-the-history-of-the-internet kind of situation. Exciting, but rather difficult.

This is a great example of the power of storytelling, process, and emphasis on data and results in talking about the effectiveness of design work. If you're working on a portfolio right now, I encourage you to take some notes on this one.
