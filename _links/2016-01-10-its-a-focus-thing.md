Ashley Ford:

> When it comes to jobs, I prefer being a guinea pig with a lot of freedom. I like to be the first in a position or to help build the team.

> I was thinking about this yesterday & realized for most of the jobs I've had, I was first in the company/organization to have that position.

> Or I was in the 1st class of people to have a position. I'm a builder. I like coming in on the ground with brilliant people I trust.

> I've been working since I was 14 & just seeing this pattern in my best job performances. Let me build or set a precedent & I do better work.

> It's a focus thing. If you put me on a conveyor built, I'll just ride. If you give me raw materials to tell me to Make, I'll focus & grow.

> I thought I'd share that because I used to think not being able to focus on conveyor-belt jobs was a weakness, but it's actually a tell.

> It was always just my head & heart trying to tell me "this isn't right for you", and "this won't sustain you". I'm glad I listened.

> It's not an easy road, but it is a privilege to have the choice to follow your curiosity. I can't believe I ever thought it made me weak.

Listen.
