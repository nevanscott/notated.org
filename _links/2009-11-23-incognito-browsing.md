I've been finally getting a chance to play around with [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/) the open source branch of the [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) project, and have been really impressed so far. My favorite tidbit is this part of the notice when you open an "Incognito Window":

<blockquote>
<p>Going incognito doesn't affect the behavior of other people, servers, or software. Be wary of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Websites that collect or share information about you</li>
<li>Internet service providers or employers that track the pages you visit</li>
<li>Malicious software that tracks your keystrokes in exchange for free smileys</li>
<li>Surveillance by secret agents</li>
<li>People standing behind you</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
