Erik D. Kennedy offers up [7 Rules for Creating Gorgeous UI (Part 1)](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda) & [Part 2](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-2-430de537ba96). Good and practical advice throughout, but I especially like this from the Introduction:

> If you went to art school or consider yourself a UI designer already, you will likely find this guide some combination of a.) boring, b.) wrong, and c.) irritating. Thatâ€™s fine. All your criticisms are right. Close the tab, move along.

I immediately went from reading with a grain of salt to disarming and digging in. Well done.

The methods for laying text over an image strike me as especially useful.
