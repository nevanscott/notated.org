Gruber responds to Brian X. Chen’s Wired piece [regarding Apple’s quarterly conference call](http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2009/01/apple-still-thi.html) titled “Apple Still Oblivious to Netbook Opportunity”:

> Sounds to me like Apple’s about as oblivious to the netbook opportunity as they were to the smartphone opportunity around, say, 2006.

I, for one, hope (nay, suspect) Gruber’s right on this one.
