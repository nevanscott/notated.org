Beautiful work by Martina Flor in crafting a systematic and flexible lettering font without losing all of the human touch:

> My aim was to create a type system that could accommodate handwriting. Therefore, I began by looking for rules or constants within handwritingâ€™s plethora of variations. First, I defined those parameters of handwriting that I could use to create a type system.

The results are really lovely.
