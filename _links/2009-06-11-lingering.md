Benjamin Kunkel:

> So I am glad, honestly, to have the old world of print and film supplemented by the new world of text and video. And I'm eager to stick up for casual and often vulgar online writing and culture as long as I'm not forced to defend them in grandiose terms. The internet often gratifies my curiosity and sense of humor, no small thing but nothing to confuse with whatever it is in me—something far more deeply interfused—that is gratified by poetry, philosophy, history, modes of writing that hardly exist online. What are the native species of internet prose? Op-eds, diary entries, aperçus, allusions, screeds, and scrawls of graffiti—worthy forms but marginal and perishable like little nodding flowers along a river.
