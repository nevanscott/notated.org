I worked most of the day today through the fog of a migraine, so this piece from [Olivia Begasse de Dhaem](https://hbr.org/search?term=olivia%20begasse%20de%20dhaem) for HBR seemed timely:

> While many people think of migraine attacks as little more than bad headaches, migraine is in fact a chronic condition whose symptoms can be far more debilitating than an ordinary headache. Migraine attacks are [often accompanied](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26350071/') by intense pain, difficulty thinking, changes in vision, dizziness, nausea, and increased sensitivity to light, noise, and smells. Furthermore, [research has shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30353868/) that migraine is among the most disabling disorders in terms of its long-term impact on quality of life, and it is extremely prevalent: 47 million Americans and over a billion people worldwide suffer from migraine, with attacks peaking during the most productive professional years (25-55 years old).

This pair of statistics stood out to me:

> While recent research is limited, studies from the last two decades found that productivity lost due to migraine costs U.S. employers at least [$13 billion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10219926/) and European employers [€27 billion](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09638288.2010.511687) every year — and these costs have likely only increased in the years since the studies were conducted.

Are U.S. workers suffering less migraines? Is this a reflection of differences in work-life balance between Europe and the U.S.?
