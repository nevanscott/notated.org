Input, from David Jonathan Ross at Font Bureau, also deserves a shout-out. I haven't played with it much yet, but it breaks with convention and offers up a font intended for code that isn't mono-spaced (fixed-width). It also comes in a variety of widths and weights, and has a serif companion style.

Perhaps most impressive of all, it is free for personal coding use, and [custom builds can be made](http://input.fontbureau.com/preview/?size=14&language=python&theme=solarized-dark&family=InputSans&width=300&weight=300&line-height=1.2&a=0&g=0&i=0&l=0&zero=0&asterisk=0&braces=0&preset=default&customize=please) to suit your preferred styles of characters like zeros and curly braces.

[From Ross's personal site](http://djr.com):

> Input came out of a conversation I had with some of my colleagues on this very topic. My boss, David Berlow asked: “Are monospaced fonts really the only solution for presenting computer code in a world with so much type technology?” Input was my response.
