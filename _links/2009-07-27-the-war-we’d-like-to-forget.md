I had high hopes for Ross Douthat's column at the <cite>Times</cite>, but haven't often found myself reading him since the move from <cite>The Atlantic</cite>. When I do take a minute to check on what he's been writing about, he simply seems out of place. Perhaps the <cite>Times</cite> really can't handle a conservative voice like his.
