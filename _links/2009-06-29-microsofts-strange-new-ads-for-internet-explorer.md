The thing is, I'd be happy if these actually got people to upgrade from IE7, IE6, or even IE5. Everyone seems to be responding to these as though Microsoft is desperate to go after Firefox and Chrome (and maybe Safari). But if you watch "G.R.I.P.E.S." it's pretty clear that these are at least partially an effort to get people using older versions of their own browser to get with the program.

I never said this, but these ads are actually a good showing from Microsoft.
