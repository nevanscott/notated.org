Khoi continues to inspire:

> For years I wanted to be the kind of writer that could write more often, more quickly, more succinctly than I do. But throughout it all, Iâ€™ve been drawn back to writing the same kind of posts, which are sort of like opinion column-style essays of 500-plus words or so, and that always takes me way more time to write than I would prefer, if given the chance. Ultimately, I just learned to accept that that was the kind of writer that I am, for better or worse.
