Intriguing concept [from Loren Burton](http://www.madebyloren.com/github-for-writers):

> For the past three years, I've used GitHub for hosting code projects, discovering bleeding edge tech, and collaborating with an engineering team. And it has been simply wonderful. In fact, it's hard to imagine coding without GitHub. I rely on GitHub every single day.
>
> However, despite how crucial GitHub is to the developer toolbox, I'm constantly wondering why the platform is limited to just code. It's not a stretch to imagine the usefulness of a similar platform for non-developers - authors, teachers, students - though as much as I search, I can't seem to find one. So I'm building it myself. I'm building a GitHub for everyone else.

I've been watching [prose.io](http://prose.io/) for a while now, and if you're familiar with that project, Penflip will look familiar. I haven't gotten to try it out yet, but I find the collaborative features very intriguing, reminiscent of [Editorially](http://stet.editorially.com/articles/introducing-editorially/).

We still need better tools, I'm glad people are still working to make them.
