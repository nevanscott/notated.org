Mitt Romney(!) in the <cite>New York Times</cite>:

> Without that bailout, Detroit will need to drastically restructure itself. With it, the automakers will stay the course â€” the suicidal course of declining market shares, insurmountable labor and retiree burdens, technology atrophy, product inferiority and never-ending job losses. Detroit needs a turnaround, not a check.

Wow.
