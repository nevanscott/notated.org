William Van Hecke:

> So much of a design role is in how much other people believe that you know what you’re talking about. You can’t quantify what makes someone a good designer. And this unquantifiability can cause tension. Passing is a sociology term for whether the way that you identify yourself matches with how other people see you.

> [<cite>Nobody Passes</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580051847/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1580051847&linkCode=as2&tag=leaiosdes-20&linkId=DPCW752LKQ5RTDH3) by Mattilda is a pretty intense compilation on the concept of passing, specifically focused on gender.

> Here’s my dear friend Nikki [talking about identity](https://twitter.com/nkkl/status/487278468397150208). “People don't react to who you are, they react to who they perceive you to be.”

Incidentally, I really like this style of presenting a talk online, with slides beside notes. Van Hecke calls out Maciej Cegłowski's [The Internet With A Human Face](http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm), which uses the same style. I also like Jonathan Corum's use of the style for his talks on information and data visualization, such as [The Weight of Rain](http://style.org/visualized/). I enjoy reading these much more than trying to flip through a deck, and I think I might even prefer it to a video of a talk.
