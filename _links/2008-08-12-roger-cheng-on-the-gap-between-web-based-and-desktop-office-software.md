I agree with the major points of this article; I think most online office-oriented tools aren’t currently much more than proof-of-concept. We use [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/) in our editorial process at Sadie Lou. Collaboration is clearly where these web apps shine.

No review of online word processors is complete without a mention of [Buzzword](https://buzzword.acrobat.com/), an excellent Flash-based app – probably the best I’ve ever seen. My money is currently on Google Docs however, which seems to continue developing in great strides.

I still think [Textile’s the shit](http://textile.thresholdstate.com/).
