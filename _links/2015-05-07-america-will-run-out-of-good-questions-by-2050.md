Ben Orlin on questions as a non-renewable resource:

> Questions were not just things to answer; they were things to think about. Things to learn from. Giving the answer too quickly cut short the thinking and undermined the learning.
>
> Good questions, in short, are a resource.
>
> Solving a math problem means unfolding a mystery, enjoying the pleasure of discovery. But in every geometry lesson that year, I blundered along and blurted out the secret. With a few sentences, I’d manage to ruin the puzzle, ending the feast before it began, as definitively as if I’d spat in my students’ soup.
>
> Math is a story, and I was giving my kids spoilers.

Definitely *not* unique to math.
