[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca) posted some comics about CSS last year:

> I’ve been writing a tiny bit more CSS recently, and I’ve decided to [actually take some time to learn CSS](https://jvns.ca/blog/debugging-attitude-matters/) instead of just flailing around and deciding “oh no, this is impossible”.
>
> CSS feels a little like systems programming / Linux to me – there are a lot of counterintuitive facts that you need to learn to be effective with it, but I think once you learn those facts it gets a lot easier.

Julia's takes are always genial and practical. Have you ever seen a more appealing breakdown of [CSS selectors](https://wizardzines.com/comics/selectors/)? No, no you have not.
