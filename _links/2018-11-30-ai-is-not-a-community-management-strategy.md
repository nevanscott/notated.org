Derek Powazek:

> This PageRank thing, they told us, was an “algorithm.” And, for a time, algorithms were all the rage. We were living in the age of the algorithm. And in all my client meetings and project plans, every time we had a decision to make, someone would say, “the algorithm will do it.”

> The algorithm never did it.

I'll let Dionne Warwick take this one:

> Gotta get off, gonna get  
> Out of this merry-go-round  
> Gotta get off, gonna get  
> Need to get on where I'm bound  
>
> When did I get, where did I  
> Why am I lost as a lamb  
> When will I know, where will I  
> How will I learn who I am
