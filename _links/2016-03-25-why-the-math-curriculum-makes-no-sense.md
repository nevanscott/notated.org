Ben Orlin:

> I’ve come to believe that even this simple question—“who designed this?”—rests on a flawed assumption. The broad thing we call “the math curriculum” isn’t really “designed.” Rather, like all educational institutions and systems, it is shaped by a hailstorm of competing forces...

I think this isn't a challenge just in education, but in the field of design at large. The idea that things can be well-planned but flawed in execution causes so many issues. Every design has to live in the real world, or it isn't design. And every real world thing will include elements that have been designed for in advance, but will have features and realities thrust at it that expose where the original design didn't account for something.

Design *can't* account for everything. Do the best you can within the constraints you're able to identify. Then make changes if it isn't working.
