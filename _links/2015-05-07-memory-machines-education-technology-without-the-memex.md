Audrey Watters:

> Rather than building devices that could enhance human memory and human knowledge *for each individual*, education technology has focused instead on devices that standardize the delivery of curriculum, that run students through various exercises and assessments, and that provide behavioral reinforcement.

We've got a lot of work to do, and I always think that the first task is to start to win over hearts and minds. And for that purpose, I'm glad Audrey Watters is around.

Audrey quotes at length from Vannevar Bush's 1945 piece [As We May Think](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) and mentions Doug Engelbart's 1962 report [Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework](http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html)--both of which should probably be required reading for anyone looking to contribute meaningfully to the role of computers in our lives. Bush's piece is the more accessible of the two, by far, but Engelbart's is worth a skim at least.
