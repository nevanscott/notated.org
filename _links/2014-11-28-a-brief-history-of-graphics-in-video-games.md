I especially enjoy Parts [One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzN2pgL0zeg&index=1&list=PLOQZmjD6P2HlOoEVKOPaCFvLnjP865X1f) and [Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1yBP5t-fSA&index=2&list=PLOQZmjD6P2HlOoEVKOPaCFvLnjP865X1f), but unfortunately from there it feels a little biased toward fairly violent games, with no real discussion of the shift. It feels pretty conspicuous. I mean, what year is this?
