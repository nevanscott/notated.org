He's got a great attitude about his approach:

> I will share some of my workflow and style choices with you but a lot of that is just how *I* present, not how *you* should present. I’ll offer only two words of advice that I think every single presenter should take seriously.
>
> To preface that advice, I’d like you to make a list of what you like and dislike about presentations you attend. Keep that list somewhere in view.

I've seen him talk about his preparation process before, but never this succinctly. His approach to using a document to outline "Narration" alongside "Images" is a great way to separate what you *say* from what your viewers *see*.

As Dan puts it, what your audience sees should *illustrate* your point, not restate it.

It's no mistake that presentations prepared in this way, with a focus on the content first as text, with images prepared as illustrations, adapt well to being presented accessibly on the web.
