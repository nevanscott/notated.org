I’ve referred to this several times, but it’s worth a re-link. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface)">Georgia</a> was commissioned by Microsoft and [designed by Matthew Carter](http://www.will-harris.com/verdana-georgia.htm) in the mid-1990s. It has been a runaway success as one of the first major typefaces designed specifically for the screen. Much of its popularity is owed to Microsoft, who released the font for free through its “Core fonts for the Web” collection, making it one of the few serif fonts available to web designers.

Georgia has been lucky, but from an aesthetic point of view, I personally think it deserves its accolades and widespread use. It is truly a great screen font, and has held up incredibly well as anti-aliasing has become the norm. I still wouldn’t use it much for print work, but it is my go-to typeface for any of [my web work](http://sadielou.net/) that needs a strong readable serif.
