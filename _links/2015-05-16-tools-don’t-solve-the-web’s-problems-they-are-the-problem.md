Peter-Paul Koch (PPK):

> Why all these tools? I see two related reasons: emulating native, and the fact that people with a server-side background coming to JavaScript development take existing tools because they do not have the training to recognise their drawbacks. Thus, the average web site has become way overtooled, which exacts a price when it comes to speed.
>
> That’s the problem. Remove the tools, and we’ll recover speed.

I agree with the fear that Koch describes as growing among the web development community, as well as part of the problem being [the shift of back-end developers to working on the client side](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/01/front_end_and_b.html).

I think the fear part is genuine, and I feel it myself.

I'll confess to having absolutely no clue as to what is going on anymore with front-end web development, despite it being my first job, and a subject I've taught for years. It would be bad enough if the problem was just lack of experience, but what I all-too-often observe is a sneering attitude about perfectly common-sense ideas like "progressive enhancement." And that includes web development *instructors* I've met.

Lately I've been trying to just ignore the whole thing. (Which isn't really working.)
