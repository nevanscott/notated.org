I'm glad that I can still be really impressed by the creativity and professionalism someone like Stéphanie puts into her website. Thoughtful touches in the writing, the illustration style, her positioning, and just overall presentation. I especially like the details on links and button styles.

And on top of that, she shares excellent links and useful resources on a regular basis. Very inspiring.
