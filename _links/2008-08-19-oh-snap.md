Jason Santa Maria exclaims his new Polaroid SX-70 in yet another beautifully art-directed post. Somehow when I look through his new posts, I get a queasy feeling like the whole setup heâ€™s got is a house of cards getting ready to come tumbling down. I just hope the [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/index.php) is keeping up with him.
