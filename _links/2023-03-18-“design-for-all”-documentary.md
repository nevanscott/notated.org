[Michelle Ngo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellngo/) recently shared this short documentary on designing inclusively that she worked on. Tight and well-edited, with so many great stories. I especially loved the fashion designs for kids, and the efforts to bring young people into the process of designing for their needs. Great stuff!
