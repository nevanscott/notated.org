Just found this great collection of photos [through Cartoon Brew](http://www.cartoonbrew.com/disney/live-action-photos-from-disneys-sleeping-beauty), part of Google’s <cite>Life</cite> archive. My favorites are the stills of Maleficent. The actress [reminds me](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/12/11/061211fa_fact) of Emil Jannings’ [Mephisto](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nevan/3093603873/) in Murnau’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust_(1926_film)"><cite>Faust</cite></a>.
