I'm really glad that this page is still available online. Andy Ihnatko:

> Trust me, I know of which I speak. "Why haven't you finished moving the redesigned site to its new servers" you ask? Because Voltaire died about a thousand years before he could tell me the above bit of wisdom and as a result, I had to pick it up on the streets.
> 
> Practical Example: Website design, specifically, taking a largish personal site and eliminating the unweildy and unworkable design you hate, transmogrifying and updating it, and putting it on a new server.
> 
> How about I create the pages in BBEdit, like I did years ago when I began Andy Ihnatko's Colossal Waste Of Bandwidth? Great idea. But hey, now there are great visual content-design tools out there. Why not re-do it all in PageMill? Done.
> 
> But boy, now that GoLive is out, I think I'd be better off with a package that offers full-blown site management features. Well, I redid it once…what's the harm in re-doing it again? I'll be actually saving time in the long run.
> 
> Oh, yeah, Dreamweaver.

As best I can tell, this dates back to at least [2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20001018115129/http://www.cwob.com/).

And here I sit, having just jumped out of my browser to edit this entry in BBEdit.
