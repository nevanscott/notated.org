[Nicholas Rougeux](https://www.c82.net) has put together a lovingly crafted interpretation of <cite>[Euclid’s Elements](https://archive.org/details/firstsixbooksofe00byrn)</cite> by Oliver Byrne from 1847. Beautiful work.

See also [A Brief Visual Exploration of A Dictionary of Typography](https://www.c82.net/typography/) based on John Southward's <cite>A Dictionary of Typography and its Accessory Arts</cite> and [Werner’s Nomenclature of Colours](https://www.c82.net/werner/) based on the work of German mineralogist Abraham Werner.

How have I missed these until now?
