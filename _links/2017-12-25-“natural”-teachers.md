Isn't this true of any field of endeavor?

I find it's often the case that those who show the most "natural" skill in something, wind up being the ones who have the most difficulty un-learning what they believe they know and understand as they work toward mastery. They're more likely to get frustrated once things become more challenging for them.

I always find it more rewarding to try to get better at things which I feel require work for me to really engage with. Anything that seems immediately obvious or straightforward to me gives me pretty major pause, because I'm probably over-simplifying it.
