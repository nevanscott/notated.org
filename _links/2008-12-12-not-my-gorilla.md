John Gruber basically gives the “fuck you” to Internet Explorer users. I tend to design the same way as he does these days:

> I have no idea whether the DF Paraphernalia store is even legible under IE, because I didn’t even bother to check. It almost certainly doesn’t look “right”. I crafted the CSS using Safari, then checked it in Firefox, and I called it done.

Neither this site nor [Midnight Breakfast](http://midnightbreakfast.com/) have been checked in IE. At least, not by me. As Gruber puts it:

> There are a lot of people who’d be a lot happier if they stopped worrying about other people’s 800 pound gorillas.
