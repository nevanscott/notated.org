A nice behind-the-scenes entry to cap off the year of [Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjFqcJQXGZ6T6sxyFB-5i6A) from Tony Szhou.

Includes some great advice from Trey Parker which I think applies to more than just film, which I'll boil down to: Strike uses of "and then" by replacing with "therefore" or "but".

Perhaps not surprising that my favorites from the series are [Jackie Chan - How to Do Action Comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ) and [Edgar Wright - How to Do Visual Comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FOzD4Sfgag).
