I hadn't come across this companion to Oliver Reichenstein's 2006 [article about the importance of typography in web design](http://informationarchitects.jp/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/). Everet takes it much further:

> So when someone says graphic design or web design is mostly about type, they're right. Our world is mostly about typography.
