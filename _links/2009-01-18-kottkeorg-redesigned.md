The text is much easier to read. Iâ€™m still getting used to the border though. It definitely [smacks of](http://flickr.com/photos/jkottke/2332588920/sizes/o/) one of [his old designs](http://kottke.org/08/03/kottkeorg-is-ten-years-old-today.) Always nice to see some continuity on the web, especially with [redesigns](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/redesignrealign).
