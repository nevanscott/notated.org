Shortly before he died on stage in 1996, musician [Tiny Tim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Khaury) did an interview with Terry Gross. For a brief interview, itâ€™s an interesting profile of the man, as he reflects not only on his way of thinking about his life, but shows how he really finds a way to embody all the music that he clearly has a passion for. His knowledge of music is stunning, and his description of new music as belonging to the young is apt and succinct.
