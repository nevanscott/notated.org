David M. Perry gets it:

> This is all nonsense, but nonsense with a purpose. Powerful men, mostly white men, are not Jews in Nazi Germany, black Americans in pre-civil-rights U.S., heretics and witches before the Salem magistrates or the Inquisition, alleged Communists before the House Un-American Activities Committee, or political dissidents in Soviet Russia. Losing a job, losing screen time, losing influenceâ€”these are not equivalent to the loss of life or freedom. Every time the playing field tilts a bit toward level, the powerful start to cry, "Help, I'm being repressed!"
