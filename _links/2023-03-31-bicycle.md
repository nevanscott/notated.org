> In this article, I’ll focus on the delicate interplay between many of the forces that act on a bicycle and its parts when riding. We’ll witness how forces applied through tires make a bicycle accelerate, brake, and turn, and we’ll also investigate how the wheels and the frame handle those different forces without breaking.

These are absolute catnip for me. My other favorites in this series: [Mechanical Watch](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/) & [Cameras and Lenses](https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/).
