I'm a little late on posting this, but it's still worth a read. Stephen T. Asma wrote a great little piece for the <cite>Chronicle of Higher Education</cite> about our relationship to the idea of monsters and makes the case that even in a liberal world of moral relativism, the idea of the monster is a useful -- and accurate -- construct. Good stuff touching a lot of ground.
