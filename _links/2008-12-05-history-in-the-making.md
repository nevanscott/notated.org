At least David Denby offers a powerful performance by Frank Langella in the upcoming <cite>Frost/Nixon</cite> to look forward to:

> Langella has mastered the rumbling voice with its occasional touch of animal growl. He leans forward as he walks, almost apelike as his arms hang down; he gets Nixon’s heaviness of bearing, the awkwardness, the grotesque sentimentality, and also his power, the dangerousness even in retreat. This man notices many things, including any eccentricity of dress, any hint of weakness in his opponent, and he’s cagey about offering signs of friendliness—an anecdote, a bit of personal advice—that would make Frost falter.

But you can really tell all that [from the trailer](http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/frostnixon/).
