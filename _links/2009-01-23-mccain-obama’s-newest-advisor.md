I agree with Jason Kottke on this. The fact that Obama is maintaining open lines of communication with McCain is great news.

> McCain, though it was his own fault (or that of his handlers), didn’t represent himself well during the presidential campaign and it’s nice to see that the very able Senator isn’t being sidelined because of it. Also, it’s quite savvy of Obama to seek out his support. He’s essentially buying McCain stock at a low point and will presumably leverage that purchase when that stock inevitably rises.

If you haven’t already, now might be a good time to go read [David Foster Wallace’s 2000 essay on McCain](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/18420304/the_weasel_twelve_monkeys_and_the_shrub).
