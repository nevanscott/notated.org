Daniel Rutter on a less-well-known skeuomorph:

> Comfort noise is a fake hiss that your mobile phone, your VoIP phone, your corporate digital phone system, whatever, creates to mask the silences between talkspurts. That hiss isn't actually coming down the line, from some analogue amplifier and hundreds of kilometres of copper; it's created independently at each end by kindly computers.
