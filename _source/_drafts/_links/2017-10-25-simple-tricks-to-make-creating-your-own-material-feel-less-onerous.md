Sam Shah and [Bowman Dickson](https://bowmandickson.com/) gave a talk at NCTM Orlando:

> Bowman and Sam both write their own content from scratch. Weâ€™ll share the simple lesson-design tricks we use to write investigations that lead to vibrant discussions and a-ha moments.

These "hacks" are definitely useful in education settings outside of mathematics as well. I'll take each approach in turn.

## 1. "Old Problem, New Problem"

The gist: take an existing problem, provide the solution to the problem, and remove some other part of the equation. More often than not, this leaves you with a more rewarding discussion on your hands.

Some possible applications that come do mind:

- Given the following news article, what do you think the journalist was asked to write?
- It turns out that air pressure and temperature have an inverse relationship. (The lower the pressure, the higher the temperature, and vice versa.) Design a demonstration to provide evidence of this relationship.
- Let's watch 5 classmates play the first level of the original Mario game. What considerations do you think the designers may have had in mind while constructing this level?

## 2. "Thinking Before Mathing"

The gist: give students the opportunity to "invent" their own approaches and vocabulary around a problem or situation, before worrying about what the broader community has already agreed upon.

- Here's a bunch of life forms. How would you organize and group them? What makes the organization system you propose useful?
- You're working with your friends to found a new club at school. What are the goals of the club? What would you propose that you and your friends agree upon to help achieve those goals?
- Write instructions for making your favorite sandwich so that anyone reading them would be able to make you a perfect sandwich.

## 3. "Make Math Magical Again"
