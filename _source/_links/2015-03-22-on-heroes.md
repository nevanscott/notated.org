Ashley Nelson-Hornstein:

> In a continuing series, Iâ€™ll highlight newfound heroes of mine. Each hero is someone that I did not know existed until recently, whose achievements were not mentioned in any of my textbooks. This inaugural post of the series begins with [Annie Jean Easley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Easley), an African-American computer programmer, mathematician, and aerospace engineer who worked at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) from 1955 - 1989.
