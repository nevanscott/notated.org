Proud to see Midnight Breakfast on this list, alongside so many other great publications.

Kinda wish she'd mentioned [Rebecca](http://rebeccarubenstein.com) (and the others) by name, but whatever. (For that matter, I also wish that the [VIDA Count](http://www.vidaweb.org) folks—awesome as they are—would make their data more open and accessible.)
