Manton Reece:

> We do not need another social network with 1 billion users. Part of the *problem* is having so many users and so much power concentrated in one place. And setting out to achieve 1 billion users means itâ€™s an ad-based platform that will inherently revisit many existing problems.

Agreed. And yet I am still bothered by the barriers of entry to alternatives, including Micro.blog. Apart from the usually-discussed technical and know-how barriers to entry (which honestly I find dubious on their own), what of social barriers? I see *a lot* of what faces whenever I check in on Micro.blog. How do we avoid revisiting *this* existing problem?
