From LettError, a way of looking at the question that I see less frequently:

> Artisans of the past — the predecessors of our designers’ guild — were rarely satisfied with tools as they found them in the shop. They always had the tendency to personalize their tools, to appropriate them by honing them, converting them or expanding them. The more specialized the work, the greater the demand for customized or individually made instruments. For instance, letter-cutters in the past thought up methods of working faster and more meticulously, and to that end they designed not only new fonts, but also counterpunches and other new tools. It must be possible to do something similar with software. After all, programming graphic programs is much too important to leave to programmers.

Earlier today I was reading [Duckspeak Vs Smalltalk: The Decline of the Xerox PARC Philosophy at Apple Computers](http://dorophone.blogspot.com/2011/07/duckspeak-vs-smalltalk.html) by J.V. Toups[^smalltalkviavictor]. This bit seems relevant:

> The designers of Smalltalk (Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, and Adele Goldberg principally, and others), given the resources and freedom of Xerox PARC, worked actively to reverse this trend. Whereas a hodgepodge of cultural and technical realities constrained the way most other programming languages looked and felt, both Smalltalk *the language and the system* were written from the ground up to be so easy that a child could use them (hence the name). It was much more ambitious than just that, however. Kay saw Xerox PARC as being on the vanguard of a real revolution in human/computer interaction. In "The Early History of Smalltalk," Alan Kay writes of this "Xerox PARC" vision of personal computing:

>> ... the user interface would have to become a learning environment along the lines of Montessori and Bruner; and [the] needs for large scope, reduction in complexity, and end-user literacy would require that data and control structures be done away with in favor of a more biological scheme of protected universal cells interacting only through messages that could mimic desired behavior.

>> ... we were actually trying for a for a qualitative paradigm shift in belief structures -- a new Kuhnian paradigm in the same spirit as the invention of the printing press...
