[Stéphanie Walter](https://stephaniewalter.design):

> Accessibility is unfortunately still an afterthought on many projects. User interaction and accessibility requirements are poorly documented, at best. Or forgotten, when handing over designs to developer teams. And fixing it later costs a LOT more than building it right to begin with. Great documentation helps teams implement accessibility requirements the right way. I will tell you why, what and how designers can document different aspects of accessibility and user interactions requirements, to build better more inclusive products.

Highly recommended.

If you prefer, Stéphanie has also given this as a talk a few times. I prefer [the recording of her talk at Inclusive Design 24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDCd-isluUY&list=PLn7dsvRdQEfHjluJsuzNto9PFhAsG3Hwb).
