If you care about making websites, and you haven't read this already, I strongly recommend and support [Jack Shedd's](http://www.bigcontrarian.com/) point of view regarding the new markup specified by HTML5.

To my ear, this is a much sharper and more clear-minded approach to thinking about the markup changes than those put forward by [Zeldman and friends](http://www.zeldman.com/superfriends/). The difference, I think, is that the "Super Friends" want to improve a standard that is close to being adopted to fit the way they work. Shedd wants to take a step back and say, what is the real problem here?

I respect and appreciate both methods of critique, especially with regards to something as wildly complex as Web Standards, but in this case, I have to say that Shedd is bringing up some very valid concerns, and I hope more discussion comes out of his article.

UPDATE: On further thinking about this, I feel it is necessary to clarify that I don't mean in any way to impugn the efforts of Jeffrey Zeldman and the other members of the "Super Friends." (I do think the name is silly, but that is surely the point.) I think it is prudent to point out that the other key difference between the two sets of critiques is that one comes from a group and the other from an individual. Shedd doesn't have to get anyone else to agree with him before posting the recommendations and critiques that he offers, which is both an advantage and disadvantage.
