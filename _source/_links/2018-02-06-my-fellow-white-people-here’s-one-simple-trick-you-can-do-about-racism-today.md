Captain Awkward:

> So, you said something racist. Or, someone told you that you said something racist.
>
> Or, someone you really like & admire said or did something racist, or is getting told on for saying something racist.
>
> And now you feel uncomfortable. You feel guilty, maybe, or ashamed. Whatever it is, it’s weird and you don’t like it.
