Nice conversation between Charlie Rose and <cite>NY Times</cite> columnist [Thomas Friedman](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/thomaslfriedman/index.html.) He was also profiled in the <cite>New Yorker</cite> in November, but unfortunately the article is only available [to subscribers](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/11/10/081110fa_fact_parker).

His talk with Charlie Rose gives a good idea of his thoughts and opinions on a wide range of current issues. A great watch.
