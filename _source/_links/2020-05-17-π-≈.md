[Christian Lawson-Perfect](https://somethingorotherwhatever.com) explains himself:

> **Why?**
>
> - I can never remember π past 3.14159..., and typing "digits of pi" into Google doesn't always lead you straight to a usable listing, so I wanted a place I could go to to easily get at least the first few hundred digits.
> - Ever since I discovered it, I've wanted to write an implementation of an unbounded spigot algorithm for π.
> - I enjoy buying novelty domain names.
> - It was a fun thing to do for π day.

I'm a total sucker for this kind of thing.
