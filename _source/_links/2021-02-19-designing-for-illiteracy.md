Last July, Lena Alfter gave a talk "Typografie für besseres Lesenlernen" at Creative Mornings Berlin about designing for illiteracy.

> As part of her master's thesis, Lena Alfter found that people with reading difficulties don't need special fonts in their learning materials, but better typographic design.[^1]

[Sebastian Greger has helpfully provided notes in English](https://sebastiangreger.net/2020/08/designing-for-illiteracy) about the talk:

> With everybody under 16 in Germany legally obliged to attend school, it can be hard to grasp that **[6 million people](https://leo.blogs.uni-hamburg.de/) (12% of the adult population) are functional analphabets** and **over 16 million (almost 1/3 of adults) have at least some kind of deficit** dealing with written text.
>
> So, designing inclusively is **not about “edge cases”**, as it is often reduced to by ableist thinking. And the impact on social participation, not least on the functioning of a democracy, is massive.
>
> Lena illustrated well how analphabets’ manifold **coping strategies contribute to hiding this fact** in daily life; some even manage to get a high school degree without ever acquiring full literacy.
