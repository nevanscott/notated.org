Peter-Paul Koch:

> In March I am going to teach the Progressive Enhancement course of the Web minor at university for the third time. I decided to expand the reading list for this course, and here I present the version Iâ€™m going to use in 2021.

Many promising resources in this list, and I'm encouraged to see that he expands beyond the scope of web development into the world of enhancement from a broader user experience perspective.

Worth the price of admission alone: For years I've made reference to the ["Hierarchy of User Needs"](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/theory-user-delight/), and until now, did not know to credit [Aarron Walter](https://www.aarronwalter.com)!
