Molly White is on the case.

If anyone out there is looking for a great RSS service, I can very happily recommend [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com). I've been a satisfied customer for 10 years, never had any problems. I mostly catch up on feeds from [Reeder](https://reeder.app) on my phone. After messaging, it's my most used appâ€”a steal for only $5. I also use [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) on my laptop sometimes, and can definitely recommend it if you're looking for a free option.
