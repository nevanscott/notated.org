Ben Fry, introducing a spell-binding visualization of Charles Darwin's changes over time to <cite>The Origin of Species</cite>:

> We often think of scientific ideas, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, as fixed notions that are accepted as finished. In fact, Darwin's <cite>On the Origin of Species</cite> evolved over the course of several editions he wrote, edited, and updated during his lifetime. The first English edition was approximately 150,000 words and the sixth is a much larger 190,000 words. In the changes are refinements and shifts in ideas â€” whether increasing the weight of a statement, adding details, or even a change in the idea itself.
