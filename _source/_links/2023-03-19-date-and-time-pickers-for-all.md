From [Devon Govett](https://twitter.com/devongovett) and the design system team at Adobe:

> This includes a full suite of fully featured components and hooks including calendars, date and time fields, and range pickers, all with a focus on internationalization and accessibility. It also includes @internationalized/date, a brand new framework-agnostic library for locale-aware date and time manipulation.

If you've ever worked on the design or implementation of components for choosing dates, I'm sure you'll appreciate the incredible amount of work and attention to detail this represents.

I've been teaching design systems and accessibility courses lately, and there's an amazing amount of overlap these days. This work from Adobe is a great example of why: building out flexible components which can be reused throughout an organization or even beyond suddenly changes the impact of accessibility efforts for those components.
