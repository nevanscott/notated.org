As interviewed by Keith Phipps at the AV Club about <cite>The Wrestler</cite>:

> AVC: You’ve changed your style radically with each film. Why so many radical shifts?
>
> DA: Well I’ve been joking that if Madonna taught us anything, you’ve got to reinvent yourself. I think it’s important as a filmmaker, as any person working in the arts, that you’ve got to try new stuff and challenge yourself and take chances. I’ve tried to take a chance with every film I’ve done—I’ve never done it the easy way, and I think that’s because that’s what excites me, is making as big a mountain as I can in front of me, and just trying to mount it.

As Kottke [puts it](http://www.kottke.org/08/12/interview-with-darren-aronofsky):

> Toddler or not, I’m getting out of the damn house to see this movie.
