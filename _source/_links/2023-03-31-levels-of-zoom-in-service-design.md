[Megan Erin Miller](https://medium.com/u/99e7e21f8833) provides a great overview:

> Service designers have to be nimble and able to see the big picture and zoom into the details. As a service is made of up a wide variety of touchpoints (points of interaction between the customer and business — think: website, app, phone call, billing statement, store, shipping notifications, etc.), by nature, we have to be able to zoom into the touchpoint level. But in order to engage the business in orchestrating a multi-touchpoint relationship with the customer (the service experience), we have to be able to engage in strategic discussions and planning to set the conditions for success for the “encounters” with the service.

I feel like something like this could also be helpful for information architecture...
