Iâ€™ve taught UX or some variant of it for a long time, over a decade.

And sometimes students would ask about if I imagine myself teaching UX forever.

And sometimes I would joke with them. Well,

Check in with me in ten years.

Right now I teach humans how to use computers to make computers more useful and understandable to other humans.

In 10 years I might be teaching computers how to make what humans do more understandable to other computers.

*[UX]: User Experience
