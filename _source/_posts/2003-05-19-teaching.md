I still believe that teaching is my true passion. Maybe it’s because it can so easily incorporate all of my different talents. Maybe it’s because it allows me to persistently ask why. I still feel that the best—maybe the only—way to learn is by teaching. Teaching requires a truer, deeper understanding of material. Even at that, it still allows your students to open your eyes every now and then. Maybe I could teach people how to teach. This is why I’ve become so “artsy”—liberal arts schools teach you how to think. Other things start to feel rote—driven by competition. And that’s certainly not what I believe drives a good means of education. This is my key complaint against TAMS—it is far too competition-driven. I want to show the world that life is a journey, not a contest. I want the world to run on cooperation, not competition. I want to shed all the rhetoric and bullshit and help pry open every person’s eyes to reality—even if only slightly. I want to make a difference.
