### What's the point of all this?

I don't really know what I'm doing here, but I feel a need for some kind of outlet, and this was available.

To be honest, I really just like the idea of having an almost completely pointless space that probably no one is paying attention to, but is mine and there for people to maybe stumble on nevertheless.
