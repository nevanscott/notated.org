When I think about limitations and constraints as they relate to the creative process, I always think of Tim Burton. In particular, I think of his earlier movies and his later work, with a breaking point hitting around the time he made <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>, perhaps earlier.

I love Burton's earlier workâ€”<cite>Edward Scissorhands</cite>, <cite>Beetlejuice</cite>, <cite>Batman</cite>, <cite>The Nightmare Before Christmas</cite>, even the less-well-known <cite>Ed Wood</cite>. In these, Burton masterfully creates worlds that his stories live in, with elements that seem characteristic of his work: stark light and shadows, off-kilter angles in normally rectilinear objects and spaces (especially doorways), worlds that alternate between extremes of color saturation. These aesthetic qualities all play well with the motifs of his films.

But if we look to some of Burton's more recent work, like his update of <cite>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</cite>
