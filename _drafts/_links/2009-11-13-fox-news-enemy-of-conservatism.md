Jon Stewart criticizes Sean Hannity's program for using footage of a more-successful Glenn Beck rally in place of footage from Michele Bachmann's sparsely-attended "Superbowl of Freedom," calling the move a "subtle altering of reality to sell a preconceived narrative."

Hannity responded by apologizing directly to Jon Stewart at the end of his program (not to his viewers), saying "You were right."

Jon, naturally, showed footage of himself trying to sit through Hannity's program, waiting for the apology, Jon and his teddy bear slowly deteriorating to the point that Jon goes into some sort of depression seizure while Teddy hangs himself from the ceiling.

(How is it appropriate to use music like Carmina Burana in a show that is ostensibly about news and politics? Olbermann, I'm looking in your direction too. Dressing up bad behavior as parody while still allegedly operating a journalistic endeavor is cheap and beneath you, sir.)
