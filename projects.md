### [Button School](https://buttonschool.com)

I'm currently building Button School in Barcelona. Our first course is a 12-week product design bootcamp.

### [UX/UI Barcelona](https://uxui.cat)

I used to teach a 9-week immersive course on user experience and user interface design at the Ironhack campus in Barcelona, Spain. I keep this website as a record of each class, which includes a lot of helpful resources for anyone else teaching or learning about UX. Enjoy!

### [Midnight Breakfast](http://midnightbreakfast.com)

Midnight Breakfast is a literary magazine I started with Rebecca Rubenstein and Taylor Pavlik. We now occasionally publish issues chock full of great fiction and nonfiction writing, paired with beautiful illustrations.

### [Learn CSS](http://learn.nevan.org)

This is an oldie that I've been considering dusting off at some point. The content is a bit dated, but I think this is still worth looking at as a nice approach to learning the basics of HTML and CSS, with the ability to see the results change as the code changes.
