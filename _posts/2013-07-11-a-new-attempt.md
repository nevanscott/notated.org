<p>I haven&#8217;t done anything remotely close to blogging in years, and truth be told, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s because I always want to blog but am just bad at it.</p>

<p>This time, I&#8217;m gonna just go with it, warts and all. I&#8217;ll write and publish when the mood strikes, and about whatever.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping that at this point I may have accrued enough experiences that I actually have something to write about. Whether it will be at all worth reading is a wholly different matter. I guess we&#8217;ll have to see.</p>
