title: Do, pair, share

One of my absolute favorite activities to use in class is a short sequence of "do, pair, share". I was introduced to the idea by some teacher pals in New York, and you can find some version of it almost anywhere teachers congregate, typically going by the name "think-pair-share" or "write-pair-share".

I first started using this approach in my design classes in 2015. I was skeptical at first. I'd tried a couple of things before recommended to me by teachers who were used to working with kids---like cold calling, and keeping a visible timer on the projector---and I was always left with this feeling that I was coming across as condescending to adult learners. I had the same doubt about this, and it was still uncomfortable for me to run this activity the first several times I tried it, but I could almost immediately see the benefits, and it motivated me to practice and improve the approach.

Now I use it all the time. It's the first thing I reach for when I have a doubt in my mind about what students are understanding about something I've been showing them, or when I want to jumpstart a conversation and get everyone participating. These days I don't even just use it in class, I find it helpful in meetings, workshops, and retrospectives---it's a wonderfully flexible tool since it works with pretty much anything that participants could spend a few minutes doing independently.

## How to do it

    <tr>
      <th>Steps</th>
      <th>Suggested time</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Give participants the short activity or question you’d like them to answer, with a time limit for how long they have to work alone.
      </td>
      <td>
        1–2 minutes
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        As participants complete the activity, observe what they are writing or drawing to see how everyone is doing.
      </td>
      <td>
        2–5 minutes
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        When time is up, ask participants to get together with a partner to discuss what they did and compare notes.
      </td>
      <td>
        1 minute
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Again, observe each pair as they discuss to check how they are doing.
      </td>
      <td>
        2–5 minutes
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Ask for volunteers or call on pairs to share what they came up with with the whole group.
      </td>
      <td>
        5–10 minutes
      </td>

## Example use

At the beginning of a lesson on planning user interviews, I like to give students a prompt such as, “Imagine that you will be doing research to learn more about people’s movie and series watching habits. Take 2 minutes to write down at least 3 different things you’d be curious to find out.” After the activity, as partners share their questions, I can collect these on a shared board, to use as a starting point for the next part of the lesson.

## Considerations for use

- Keep the activity small and manageable in scope
- Give clear instructions for the activity; consider showing them in writing where everyone can see
- Depending on the activity, it may help to provide participants with a template or worksheet
- A visible countdown timer can help keep participants on task during the activity

### Considerations for use in person

- If possible, arrange the room so you can walk around and observe without disturbing participants
- Ask participants to find a new partner, or someone they don’t know well, each time you have them pair

### Considerations for use in remote

- Do the solo part of the activity quietly together in the primary room, then split into randomized breakout rooms for pairing
- Use a shared digital canvas for the activity, where everyone can see everyone’s work
- Consider creating a template with a space for participants to put their name and work in the shared canvas
- At the end, share your screen to drive the focus of the group toward whichever pair is sharing what they came up with
