I want to admit something that I wish more people would admit: I'm confused.

I like to think that I know what I'm talking about, and I believe I put a great deal of thought and care into what I do, but neither of those things keep me from being confused. I don't have a good idea about what the web is really for, where new technologies are going, whatever on earth is going on with the "tech industry," or anything of that nature.

And yet I teach. I teach design now, and taught web development in the past. Sometimes I feel confused about why I should be teaching when I myself am so confused about the industry my own students are hoping to become better acquainted with.

But. <em>That</em> is probably <em>why</em> I teach. Because I'm confused and want to continue to work toward a greater understanding, and also because I'm willing to admit my confusion, and hopefully let my students in a little more as a result.

All that said, what I'm always advocating for in class is increasing the clarity of ideas. Maybe I'm talking to myself above all.
